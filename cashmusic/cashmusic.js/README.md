#cashmusic.js
cashmusic.js is a lightweight library that handles CASH Music embeds, does some basic video 
lightboxing, and provides a simple interface to audio (via SoundManager 2.) It also introduces 
animating all elements of a page against audio progress, all with no scripting at all. Define 
waypoints in an element's data attributes using simple JSON and the library handles all tweening. 
   
   
##License  
cashmusic.js is distributed under a simplified BSD License, included here â€” so pretty much go nuts. 
Build rad stuff. Give back where you can.
   
  
#Dependencies  
There are no external dependencies other than SoundManager 2 for audio playback. We've taken lengths 
to make sure we don't interfere with jQuery or similar libraries, so cashmusic.js should play well 
with others.
