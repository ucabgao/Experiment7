	h4 What is Pair Programming?
	p.justify
		| Pair programming is a software development technique in which two programmers work together on a single workstation. One, the 
		| driver, writes code while the other, the observer or (sometimes called navigator), reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The 
		| two programmers switch roles frequently.
		br
		| While reviewing, the observer also considers the strategic direction of the work and the overall design, coming up with ideas for 
		| improvements and likely problems that may need to be addressed. This should free up the driver to focus all of their effort on the 
		| "tactical" aspects of completing the current task, using the observer as a guide.

	h4 Who is this website for?
	p.justify
		| The website features an IDE supporting many languages. Any developer or student is welcome to use this as a tool for creating software
		| . While the IDE supports pair programming it does not necessarily require you to do so. For those who do find they need to work on 
		| software with a partner but can't easily meet up with them in person this application is specifically targeted to you.

	h4 Whats the difference between the express session and an account session?
	p.justify
		| The express session is a quick way to start developing immediately it is meant for users who are not signed in or users who do not 
		| want to save their work. If you have an account you can manage your different projects in a session and save your work.
