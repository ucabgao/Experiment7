Pops: Bootstraping Django's Admin
=================================
Introducing Django's `admin`_ to Twitter's `Bootstrap`_.

This is built on top of the work of `django-admintools-bootstrap`_ and utilizes
`django-admin-tools`_.

.. warning:: This is development software and prone to constant change.  Tread carefully.

Installation & Configuration
----------------------------
You can install the development version of this package using `pip`_:

::

    $ git clone git://github.com/tswicegood/pops.git
    $ cd pops && pip install .

Next, you must add ``pops`` to the list of ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your Django
settings before `django-admin-tools`_.  Note, you have to have a properly
`installed and configured`_ admin-tools package in order to use pops.

What's in a name?
-----------------
"Pops" is one of Louis Armstrong's `nicknames`_.  This project is being done
for integration with the `Armstrong Project`_, which is named after Mr.
Armstrong.  Pops is completely independent of the project, however, so we
decided to give it a different, albeit still related, name.
