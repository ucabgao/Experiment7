# OpenList Chrome Extension

OpenList helps you manage lists of URLs. It's useful if you have a habit of emailing yourself lists of articles or pages to check out later.

With OpenList, you can:

* select a list of URLs (or search terms) in any web page or textarea, then open them all in new tabs
* paste a list of URLs (or search terms) into a popup, then open them all in new tabs
* get a list of all tabs in the current window

The name should probably be changed to something like TabsList, but that's a lot of effort.

## Installation

[Download the extension from the Chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nkpjembldfckmdchbdiclhfedcngbgnl). It's free!

## Issues

Please open an issue on [the GitHub issue tracker for this project](https://github.com/cdzombak/OpenList/issues).
