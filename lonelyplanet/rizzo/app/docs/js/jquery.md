# jQuery

We use it! We support IE8 and our application is built on the existence of jQuery as a construct.

We have considered removing jQuery as a dependency but for many reasons have chosen not to. Frankly, we are currently much less concerned with the extra Xkb of code than we are with:

- Syntax familiarity
- Not reimplementing abstractions
- Dealing with modern browser inconsistencies
