# Image Optimisation

All images served on lonelyplanet.com should be in the most efficient format as well as losslessly optimised . You can losslessly optimise images manually using these tools:

- [JPEGMini](http://www.jpegmini.com/)
- [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/)
- [ImageAlpha](http://pngmini.com/)

# Resrc.it

We have a contract with a 3rd party image API which can resize, crop, optimise your images on the fly. The only caveat is that the images need to be stored on a Lonely Planet domain. There is a helper within Rizzo that abstracts some of the complexity around this service. For full documentation you can visit the [resrc.it docs](http://www.resrc.it/docs/optimize).
